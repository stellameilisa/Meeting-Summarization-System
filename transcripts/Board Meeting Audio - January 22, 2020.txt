All right. I've got a 9:30. So we'll go ahead and get started in the for these meetings during session as a reminder will do a legislative update men administrative update and then any questions that you have but there won't be action items scheduled. There's nobody here in the boardroom. Are we do have? Jason Todd a Torino and wolf online on the phone for the legislative update all of the board bills have been introduced into the session the select committee on pension policy joint bill with DRS. The decision was made just to use the same bills from last year that were still alive. So the month of death bills are 1414 and 5335 same as last year. The two new bills left to the first one. The Survivor option re-election is 2678 and 6417 at this point in time. Neither of those bills have been scheduled for hearings. The third bill has to do with the definition of. Of War that's 2655 and 6418. That's the bill as you'll recall that deals with interrupted military service and it was a left to only Bill provided a couple of technical Corrections. Did not expand the shirt the coverage for interruptive free interruptive military service credit beyond the current policy. That bill is scheduled for a hearing and House Appropriations tomorrow afternoon. There's a second Bill definition of Veteran by representative Paul 2544. That bill is also scheduled for hearing in the House Appropriations tomorrow afternoon that bill. Takes one of the technical Corrections that the left to board used. And but not the other and then it also expands to include expeditionary service. So we have notified the sponsor of the bill and notified committee staff about the potential differences between the two bills that bill applies to all the plans. Just left two. we'll be monitoring and working with staff to kind of make sure that the conflict between the two bills is everybody is well aware of it right now. There's nothing else to say we'll know more after the bills are heard tomorrow. As far as other bills affecting left to the only other thing worth mentioning right now is that the department of Retirement Systems has a bill introduced to help protect. The privacy of members medical information will keep you appraised on that one and we're tracking that one on our website as well as all the other bills that I previously discussed. Are there any questions about any of the bills? David Jason, I don't have a question on any of the bills, but I do have an unrelated question whenever that's appropriate as you may or may not know organization called the freedom Foundation has filed a PDR or Idrs, for everybody's information. And of course that throughout the course of the last two months people have been getting emails. From their agencies notifying other employers are the same hate to see you guys know you're going to the ER so on so forth. We had a discussion that you've heard anything from legislators or anything like that. I mean, we all know how PR Works. Do you know that there is a law enforcement exemption only to us to that. Can you just speak to that? I don't have an expectation that you know everything about it. I just didn't know if if if you guys have heard any Buzz or anyting yeah, so there is some stuff going on. Let me kind of backup. In general context the laws are trying to catch up with the technology in this area. So for instance, you talked about limited exceptions for law enforcement. There's also some exceptions about releasing private information about certain employees. So for instance, if somebody's been the victim of stalking you're not supposed to be releasing their private information. agencies are supposed to keep a database of those types of which employees are subject to which exceptions one of the things that the freedom Foundation have and others have a trip to though is that you can pull together public information from a number of different agencies and stuff online and pretty much get whatever you want. So for instance, they can get information. That's historically been releasable. If you will from the Department of Retirement Systems and do a web search and get the home mailing addresses or home addresses for just about anybody that they want. And in addition to you guys getting emails about the public disclosure request for instance teachers have already received mailings at home encouraged from the freedom Foundation encouraging them to opt out of that unions. It's expected that other Public Employee groups and probably you guys as well eventually will get the same types of mailing. there's In Washington, there is a very broad policy goal of open. Public records and so there's kind of a struggle right now to find the right balance between what is and is not appropriate for early. So that question Jason a is being reconsidered but I can't say that there's any sort of specific proposals right now. There are a number of different bills out there and there may be some movement on it this session, but I don't know that it's going to happen that quickly. So so our office is on this very closely and trying to coordinate the advice because that's as even you pointed out there at the request is going out to all agencies in addition to the Dr to the DRS. Right and it's my understanding that currently it is currently there is basically an injunction or the courts to stop at the moment because of this issue of identifying score within the records for whom that information cannot be released, right but an impasse momentarily and actually I just got an update yesterday there was The freedom Foundation has asked for direct review to the Supreme Court that have been trying to accelerate or move things along in the courts because they see so the state position as being one of potentially. On the basis of pain a limited pool people is to pointed out who who Who's information is completely protected and it is the only thing I would say, so right now nothing's happening. I agree with Steve's assessment that it would be extraordinary for there to be a legislative courts will hear this and it'll be really interesting to see what comes out of that and now that and I will make sure going forward that I will send all of the periodic updates that our office gets I will make sure that that Stephen Stephen you guys have that so that you can stay abreast of the issue. Say thank you. Torrent Steve. Appreciate it. You're welcome, Jason. Alright for are there any other questions about legislation before I move on to the administrative update? All right real quick on the admin update. We still have not received approval from ofm to begin looking at alternate sites to move to the budget package for the agency move was included in the governor's budget. So we're moving forward. I had hoped to have approval before this meeting, but that's I'd also had hoped to have approval before December and before November. So this is just I don't know when to Expect that that will happen but I don't think that there is any change in the plan for the upcoming interim which again is to continue to be located in the same building where we're at and all of the board meetings for next year except for the October off-site will be also here in this s i b boardroom. as far as a budget update the Second-quarter budget reports were included in your materials wear under spent right now. Slightly and projected to be under spent right now for the biennium by about $33,000. So we're slightly ahead of schedule most of that has to do with With some of the expenses related to the study for the Tribal Police. I don't know if any of you have any questions about the the budget and if you haven't had a chance to look over the documents. The budget spreadsheet that was sent out. Please feel for you to call or email me at anytime if you got questions about anything that's on that. As far as Outreach activities the state Council of firefighters has their legislative conference, February 4th and 5th. We will be there to listen and answer questions. Walk-offs has their winter meeting February 10th through 12th and be the same thing will probably be providing some kind of board legislative update and be there to answer questions as well. We will send out updates as session. Continues so will we either by text or by email inform you when bored bills are scheduled for hearings and that kind of stuff remembered? Also. We are rumor control Central. So if you hear crazy rumors about some potential piece of legislation operon, since there's already a lot of stuff circulating about the benefit Improvement account, please you can reach out to me and I'd be happy to let you know what is or isn't accurate about any of those rumors at any time. That's we do that all the time during session. So don't feel like you have to wait till the next board meeting. The next board meeting is February 26th at set at 9:30 and it will be similar to this meeting. It'll just be primarily electronic with a ledge update administrative update and Q&A. Any questions about the administrative items or about something that I have not covered? No Steve, this is Mark. Can you hear me? Yeah, I got on just a little bit late. So. Just want the record to show that I was here. That's all. Thank you. Thank you for your all your hard work yet. We'll get that noted. And then did you have any questions at the ledge updates fairly straightforward? All the board bills are in the military Bill be heard in the house tomorrow. There's another military Bill looks slightly different. We're coordinating those difference. Okay, are you going to testify on that? I'm going to give Jacob a chance to testify this session. Okay, we will be there. Yeah. Okay. Well. I'll look for the video. Any other questions? All right. I think you're good to go then wolf. Good. Thank you. Thank you, Steve. You're welcome all day.
